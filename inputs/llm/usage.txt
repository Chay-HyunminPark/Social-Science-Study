Write me a script in R to simulate the following scenario, from the year 1980 to 2020 we are provided with data set for the birth rates in US.
We are going to create both tables and graphs.
For the first figure, we are trying to graph the trend in US Birth Rates. Putting 'births per 1000 women age 15-44' on y-axis and 'year' on x-axis.
For the first table, we have two columns, year and birth.
For the second table, we have year on the left column and relevant subgroups on the other columns. For instance, we have brate_1519, brate_2024, brace_2529, brate_hisp, brate_college, brate_married, etc 
and each row represents the births.
For the second figure, we have multiple line graphs each represent the subgroup having year on x-axis and number of births on y-axis.
For the third table, we have two columns one with state_name illustrating the states of the US and other with brate_1544_thsnds_ch_pct depicting the change in birth rates in negative values. For the third figure, we want to graph a map of the US. It is all divided into states and we have a 'change in birth rate' as a legend. Green denoting the change larger than 0, blue represents the change from 0 to -5. Orange represents the change in birth rate from -5 to -10. Red depicts the change in birth rate less than -10. 

ChatGPT
Below is a script in R to simulate the scenario you described:

```R
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(usmap)

# Simulated birth rate data from 1980 to 2020
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
birth_data <- data.frame(
  year = 1980:2020,
  births = rnorm(41, mean = 1000, sd = 100)
)

# Generate subgroup data
subgroup_data <- data.frame(
  year = rep(1980:2020, each = 6),
  subgroup = rep(c("brate_1519", "brate_2024", "brate_2529", "brate_hisp", "brate_college", "brate_married"), times = 41),
  births = rnorm(41*6, mean = 500, sd = 50)
)

# Generate state-level birth rate change data
state_data <- data.frame(
  state_name = state.name,
  brate_1544_thsnds_ch_pct = runif(length(state.name), min = -15, max = 15)
)

# First figure: Trend in US Birth Rates
ggplot(birth_data, aes(x = year, y = births)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Births per 1000 women age 15-44", title = "Trend in US Birth Rates")

# First table: Year and Births
birth_data_table <- birth_data

# Second table: Year and Subgroup Births
subgroup_data_table <- spread(subgroup_data, key = subgroup, value = births)

# Second figure: Multiple line graphs for subgroups
ggplot(subgroup_data, aes(x = year, y = births, color = subgroup)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Births", title = "Trend in Subgroup Birth Rates")

# Third table: State-wise Birth Rate Change
state_data_table <- state_data

# Third figure: Map of US with change in birth rate legend
usmap::plot_usmap(data = state_data, values = "brate_1544_thsnds_ch_pct", lines = "lightgray") +
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "Change in Birth Rate", low = "red", high = "green", breaks = c(-15, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15), labels = c("< -10", "-5 to -10", "-5 to 0", "0", "0 to 5", "5 to 10", "> 10")) +
  labs(title = "Change in Birth Rate by State")
```

Please note that the birth rate data and subgroup data are simulated for demonstration purposes. You would need to replace them with actual data if available. Additionally, the legend for the map in the third figure is based on simulated data and may need adjustments based on the actual data distribution.

write me three test codes that can be applied to the dataset we created before

ChatGPT
Sure, here are three test codes that can be applied to the dataset we created before:

1. Test code to check the summary statistics of the birth rate data:

```R
summary(birth_data)
```

2. Test code to visualize the distribution of birth rates over the years:

```R
hist(birth_data$births, main = "Distribution of Birth Rates", xlab = "Births per 1000 women age 15-44", ylab = "Frequency")
```

3. Test code to calculate the correlation between birth rates and year:

```R
cor(birth_data$year, birth_data$births)
```

These test codes provide a quick way to check the summary statistics, visualize the distribution, and calculate the correlation of the birth rate data we generated earlier.

User
From this code: 
```{r}
#| echo: false

#| warning: false
#| label: fig-usbrate-graph
#| fig-cap: "Trend in US Birth Rates"

### Trend in US Birth Rates

# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Read the data from CSV file
data <- read.csv(file = here::here("outputs/data/fig_1.csv"))

# Plotting the data
ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = brate_all)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2007, linetype = "dotted") +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Births per 1,000 women age 15-44",
       title = "Trend in US Birth Rates",
       caption = "Birth Rates collected from CDC Vital Statistics Births Reports for 2015, 2019 and 2020.") +
  theme_classic()
```

Please modify the R script. I want to add more lines on the y-axis and x-axis. For instance, I want to have y-axis starting from 50 and goes up to 80 by 5. And I want to have the x-axis year from 1980 to 2020 goes up by 5 years but still want to have slits for every year. 

ChatGPT
Sure, I'll modify the R script to adjust the y-axis and x-axis scales as per your requirements:

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Read the data from CSV file
data <- read.csv(file = here::here("outputs/data/fig_1.csv"))

# Plotting the data
ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = brate_all)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2007, linetype = "dotted") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(50, 80), breaks = seq(50, 80, by = 5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1980, 2020), breaks = seq(1980, 2020, by = 5), minor_breaks = seq(1980, 2020, by = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Births per 1,000 women age 15-44",
       title = "Trend in US Birth Rates",
       caption = "Birth Rates collected from CDC Vital Statistics Births Reports for 2015, 2019, and 2020.") +
  theme_classic()
```

This script will adjust the y-axis scale to start from 50 and go up to 80, with breaks at every 5 units. Similarly, the x-axis scale will start from 1980 and go up to 2020 with breaks at every 5 years, and minor breaks at every year.


User
I also want to note 2007 on the 2007 dotted line. And I want to have horizontal lines in light grey colour that's extended from the y-axis.

ChatGPT
Certainly, I'll add annotations for the year 2007 on the dotted line and horizontal lines extending from the y-axis to enhance readability:

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Read the data from CSV file
data <- read.csv(file = here::here("outputs/data/fig_1.csv"))

# Plotting the data
ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = brate_all)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2007, linetype = "dotted") +
  annotate("text", x = 2007, y = 80, label = "2007", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, color = "black") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(50, 80, by = 5), color = "lightgrey") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(50, 80), breaks = seq(50, 80, by = 5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1980, 2020), breaks = seq(1980, 2020, by = 5), minor_breaks = seq(1980, 2020, by = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Births per 1,000 women age 15-44",
       title = "Trend in US Birth Rates",
       caption = "Birth Rates collected from CDC Vital Statistics Births Reports for 2015, 2019, and 2020.") +
  theme_classic()
```

This script will add annotations for the year 2007 on the dotted line and horizontal lines in light grey color extended from the y-axis.

User
I want to have scale from 1980 to 2020 for each year

ChatGPT
If you want to have a tick mark for each year from 1980 to 2020 on the x-axis, you can adjust the breaks in the scale_x_continuous function. Here's the modified script:

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Read the data from CSV file
data <- read.csv(file = here::here("outputs/data/fig_1.csv"))

# Plotting the data
ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = brate_all)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2007, linetype = "dotted") +
  annotate("text", x = 2007, y = 80, label = "2007", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, color = "black") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(50, 80, by = 5), color = "lightgrey") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(50, 80), breaks = seq(50, 80, by = 5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1980, 2020), breaks = seq(1980, 2020, by = 1)) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Births per 1,000 women age 15-44",
       title = "Trend in US Birth Rates",
       caption = "Birth Rates collected from CDC Vital Statistics Births Reports for 2015, 2019, and 2020.") +
  theme_classic()
```

This script will set tick marks for each year from 1980 to 2020 on the x-axis.

User
but only have x-axis tag goes up by 5 such as 1980, 1985, 1990 

ChatGPT
Got it, you want to label the x-axis with years that increase by 5, while still having ticks for every year. Here's how you can modify the x-axis scale to achieve this:

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Read the data from CSV file
data <- read.csv(file = here::here("outputs/data/fig_1.csv"))

# Plotting the data
ggplot(data, aes(x = year, y = brate_all)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2007, linetype = "dotted") +
  annotate("text", x = 2007, y = 80, label = "2007", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, color = "black") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = seq(50, 80, by = 5), color = "lightgrey") +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(50, 80), breaks = seq(50, 80, by = 5)) +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(1980, 2020), breaks = seq(1980, 2020, by = 1), labels = function(x) ifelse(x %% 5 == 0, x, "")) +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Births per 1,000 women age 15-44",
       title = "Trend in US Birth Rates",
       caption = "Birth Rates collected from CDC Vital Statistics Births Reports for 2015, 2019, and 2020.") +
  theme_classic()
```

In this modified script, the labels on the x-axis will only display for years that are multiples of 5, but tick marks will still appear for every year from 1980 to 2020.

User
Write me R scripts such that I can create two line graphs.
For the first line graphs, it's A: Five-year age group in Times New Roman font.
y-axis called "Births per 1,000 women in relevant population subgroup"
x-axis for year from 1980 to 2020. I'd like to have every scale from 1980 to 2020 only counts the ones that goes up by 5 for instance 1980, 1985, 1990. For the y-axis its starting from 0 to 140 goes up by 20 and having horizontal lines extending from the y-axis to enhance readability in light grey colour. 
For the first CSV file, we are only going to use 'year', 'brate_1519', 'brate_2024', 'brate_2529', 'brate_3034', 'brate_3539', 'brate_4044' from the <figs_2a_2b> CSV file. 
Color them differently and add the label for each column in Times New Roman font when representing as a line on a graph. For example, Age 15-19 for brate_1519 and Age 20 - 24 for brate_2024.
Age 40-44 from brate_4044 we want to have it in green.
Age 35-39 from brate_3539 we want to have it in cyan.
Age 15-19 from brate_1519 we want to have it in blue.
Age 30-34 from brate_3034 we want to have it in yellow.
Age 20-24 from brate_2024 we want to have it in orange.
Age 25-29 from brate_2529 we want to have it in grey. 
Note 2007  in dotted line.

Next, the second one is called B: Race and ethnicity (ages 15-44) in Times New Roman font..
We want to place the second graph right next to the first one.
it follows the similar trends for the y-axis and x-axis but instead x-axis starts from 1990 because we are missing values from the 1980. 
We'll use 'brate_whitenh', 'brate_blacknh', 'brate_hisp' columns from the <figs_2a_2b> CSV file.
Color Hispanic from the column 'brate_hisp' in grey. Label them as 'Hispanic' in Times New Roman font.
Color Black, non-Hispanic from the column 'brate_blacknh' in orange. Label them as 'Black, non-Hispanic' in Times New Roman font.
Color White, non-Hispanic from the column 'brate_whitenh' in blue. Label them as 'White, non-Hispanic' in Times New Roman font.

ChatGPT
To create the two line graphs with the specified requirements, we'll first load the necessary libraries, read the CSV file, and then plot each graph individually.

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Read the data from CSV file

# Arrange both graphs side by side
library(gridExtra)
grid.arrange(graph_A, graph_B, nrow = 1)

This script will create two line graphs: the first one representing trends in US birth rates by age group, and the second one representing trends in US birth rates by race/ethnicity. Both graphs meet your specifications regarding the axis scales, colors, labels, and annotations.

User
graph them in classic theme

ChatGPT
Sure, I'll modify the script to use the `theme_classic()` theme for both graphs:

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

# Read the data from CSV file
figs_2a_2b <- read.csv("figs_2a_2b.csv")

       caption = "Birth Rates collected from CDC Vital Statistics Births Reports for 2015, 2019, and 2020.") +
  theme_classic()

# Arrange both graphs side by side
grid.arrange(graph_A, graph_B, nrow = 1)

This script sets the seed for reproducibility and reads the data from the CSV file located at the specified path using the `here` package. It then creates two line graphs using the `ggplot2` package with the classic theme.

I don't need a legend on the side, I want to label them directly on the lines. Also remark 2007 on the 2007 dotted line. For the x-axis, I want the years to be slanted to increase readability.

This script will generate two line graphs with labels directly on the lines, remarks for 2007 on the dotted lines, and slanted x-axis labels for better readability. The `family = "Times"` argument is used to specify the Times New Roman font for the labels.

I don't need to add the x-axis and y-axis labels, also only keep one caption <Note: Birth rates by age group, race, and ethnicity, and marital status gathered from CDC Vital Statistics Births Reports. Birth rates by Hispanic subpopulation, mother's education are calculated by the original author's using NCHS Vital Statistics birth micro data, SEER population data, and the Current Population Survey.>

This code will label each line directly on the graph instead of using a legend, as per your requirement.

User
still I see legend on the side, I don't want to see the legend at all. 
All I want is line graphs with each line labeled itself. 
For instance, a line using CSV column 'brate_2529' is in light grey colour and label that line as 'Age 25-29' in Times New Roman font. 
A line using CSV column 'brate_2024' is in orange colour and label that line as 'Age 20-24' in Times New Roman font. 
A line using CSV column 'brate_3034' is in yellow colour and label that line as 'Age 30-34' in Times New Roman font. 
A line using CSV column 'brate_1519' is in blue colour and label that line as 'Age 15-19' in Times New Roman font. 
A line using CSV column 'brate_3539' is in cyan colour and label that line as 'Age 35-39' in Times New Roman font. 
A line using CSV column 'brate_4044' is in green colour and label that line as 'Age 40-44' in Times New Roman font.

Modify it such that I have 2007 dotted line labeled as 2007. 
And each line's label is located on the left part of the lines. 
Also add a line to set tick marks for each year from 1980 to 2020 on the x-axis.

To make the line graphs thinner and the lines themselves smaller, you can adjust the `size` parameter in `geom_line` to a smaller value. Additionally, you can modify the size of the text labels to make them smaller. Here's the modified code:

```r

        legend.position = "none")

# Arrange both graphs side by side
grid.arrange(graph_A, graph_B, nrow = 1)
```

In this code, I reduced the `size` parameter in `geom_line` to make the lines thinner and adjusted the `size` parameter in `geom_text` to make the text labels smaller. Additionally, I set the `size` parameter in `element_text` within the `theme` function to make the x-axis text smaller.

Add lines of code such that I use csv file, <fig_2e> which has columns, "year", "brate_unmarried", "brate_married"
"Year" should goes on the x-axis. "brate_unmarried" has colour orange, line graph label with "Married." "brate_married" has colour blue, line graph label with "Unmarried." 
On the x-axis, there's a dotted vertical line on 2007 and label that dotted line as '2007.' 
For x-axis, name it as "Births per 1,000 women in relevant population subgroup." Its range is from 0 to 140 goes up by 20. 
For y-axis, put null value for the name and year counts from 1980 to 2020 scale for every year but only counts every 5 years. For instance, 1980, 1985, 1990.  

ChatGPT
To add another line graph using the data from the <fig_2e> CSV file and meet the specified requirements, you can follow this additional code:

```r
# Read the data from the new CSV file fig_2e
data_2e <- read.csv(file = here::here("path/to/fig_2e.csv"))

# Plotting the third line graph (Graph C)
graph_C <- ggplot(data_2e, aes(x = year)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = brate_unmarried, color = "blue"), size = 0.4) +
  geom_line(aes(y = brate_married, color = "orange"), size = 0.4) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2007, linetype = "dotted") +
  annotate("text", x = 2007, y = 120, label = "2007", vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, color = "black", family = "Times") +

        legend.position = "none")

# Arrange all three graphs side by side
grid.arrange(graph_A, graph_B, graph_C, nrow = 1)
```

This code reads the data from the new CSV file <fig_2e>, creates a new line graph (`graph_C`) using the specified columns, and adds it to the arrangement of the existing graphs (`graph_A` and `graph_B`). The new graph follows the provided requirements, including the use of color, labeling, and axis configurations.

To add the x-axis scale from 0 to 140 with increments of 20 to each of the three graphs (graph_A, graph_B, and graph_C), you can use the `scale_y_continuous()` function with the `limits` and `breaks` arguments. Here's the modified code:

Sure, you can rename the column names using the `rename()` function from the `dplyr` package. Here's the modified script with the column names renamed as requested:

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

# Read the data from CSV file
data <- read.csv(file = here::here("outputs/data/figs_2a_2b.csv"))

# Filter the data to include years starting from 1990
filtered_data <- data %>%
  filter(year >= 1990)

# Select the required columns and rename them
selected_data <- filtered_data %>%
  select(Year = year, White = brate_whitenh, Black = brate_blacknh, Hispanic = brate_hisp)

# Print the table using additional styling
kable(selected_data, caption = "Trends in Birth Rates by Population Race and Ethnicity (ages 15-44)", format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %>%
  add_header_above(c("","Births per 1,000 women" = 3))
```

This script will generate a table with the specified column names: Year, White, Black, and Hispanic. Make sure to replace `"outputs/data/figs_2a_2b.csv"` with the correct file path if it's located in a different directory.

User
make the histogram based on the table we just created.

ChatGPT
To create a histogram based on the table we just created, we can use the `ggplot2` library in R. Here's how you can do it:

```R
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Define the data for the histogram
hist_data <- selected_data %>%
  select(White, Black, Hispanic) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(White, Black, Hispanic), names_to = "Race", values_to = "Births_per_1000_women")

# Create the histogram
ggplot(hist_data, aes(x = Births_per_1000_women, fill = Race)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, position = "dodge", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Birth Rates by Population Race and Ethnicity (ages 15-44)",
       x = "Births per 1,000 women",
       y = "Frequency") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("White" = "blue", "Black" = "red", "Hispanic" = "green")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

This code will generate a histogram where each bar represents the frequency of birth rates for each racial/ethnic group (White, Black, Hispanic) in the selected_data table. Adjust the `binwidth` parameter in the `geom_histogram` function to change the width of the bins if needed.

User
From this code,

  geom_bar(aes(y = Black, fill = "Black"), stat = "identity", position = "stack") +

only mark every 5 years for instance, 1990, 1995, 2000. Still keep the scale for each year.
