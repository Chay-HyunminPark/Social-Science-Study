Write me a script in R to simulate the following scenario, from the year 1980 to 2020 we are provided with data set for the birth rates in US.
We are going to create both tables and graphs.
For the first figure, we are trying to graph the trend in US Birth Rates. Putting 'births per 1000 women age 15-44' on y-axis and 'year' on x-axis.
For the first table, we have two columns, year and birth.
For the second table, we have year on the left column and relevant subgroups on the other columns. For instance, we have brate_1519, brate_2024, brace_2529, brate_hisp, brate_college, brate_married, etc 
and each row represents the births.
For the second figure, we have multiple line graphs each represent the subgroup having year on x-axis and number of births on y-axis.
For the third table, we have two columns one with state_name illustrating the states of the US and other with brate_1544_thsnds_ch_pct depicting the change in birth rates in negative values. For the third figure, we want to graph a map of the US. It is all divided into states and we have a 'change in birth rate' as a legend. Green denoting the change larger than 0, blue represents the change from 0 to -5. Orange represents the change in birth rate from -5 to -10. Red depicts the change in birth rate less than -10.

Below is a script in R to simulate the scenario you described:

```R
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(usmap)

# Simulated birth rate data from 1980 to 2020
set.seed(123) # for reproducibility
birth_data <- data.frame(
  year = 1980:2020,
  births = rnorm(41, mean = 1000, sd = 100)
)

# Generate subgroup data
subgroup_data <- data.frame(
  year = rep(1980:2020, each = 6),
  subgroup = rep(c("brate_1519", "brate_2024", "brate_2529", "brate_hisp", "brate_college", "brate_married"), times = 41),
  births = rnorm(41*6, mean = 500, sd = 50)
)

# Generate state-level birth rate change data
state_data <- data.frame(
  state_name = state.name,
  brate_1544_thsnds_ch_pct = runif(length(state.name), min = -15, max = 15)
)

# First figure: Trend in US Birth Rates
ggplot(birth_data, aes(x = year, y = births)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Births per 1000 women age 15-44", title = "Trend in US Birth Rates")

# First table: Year and Births
birth_data_table <- birth_data

# Second table: Year and Subgroup Births
subgroup_data_table <- spread(subgroup_data, key = subgroup, value = births)

# Second figure: Multiple line graphs for subgroups
ggplot(subgroup_data, aes(x = year, y = births, color = subgroup)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(x = "Year", y = "Number of Births", title = "Trend in Subgroup Birth Rates")

# Third table: State-wise Birth Rate Change
state_data_table <- state_data

# Third figure: Map of US with change in birth rate legend
usmap::plot_usmap(data = state_data, values = "brate_1544_thsnds_ch_pct", lines = "lightgray") +
  scale_fill_continuous(name = "Change in Birth Rate", low = "red", high = "green", breaks = c(-15, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15), labels = c("< -10", "-5 to -10", "-5 to 0", "0", "0 to 5", "5 to 10", "> 10")) +
  labs(title = "Change in Birth Rate by State")
```

Please note that the birth rate data and subgroup data are simulated for demonstration purposes. You would need to replace them with actual data if available. Additionally, the legend for the map in the third figure is based on simulated data and may need adjustments based on the actual data distribution.
