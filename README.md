# Social Science Study on Birth Rates on US

This repository focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to ~

## Statement on LLM Usage
Certain sections of the code were generated with the assistance of ChatGPT3.5. The complete chat history is available in `inputs/llms/usage.txt`. It's important to acknowledge the collaboration with this language model to enhance the analytical process.

## Reproducibility

### Dependencies
To reproduce the analysis, ensure you have the following R packages installed:

- `knitr`
- `lubridate`
- `tidyverse`
- `kableExtra`
- `ggplot2`

You can install these packages using the following command:

```R
install.packages(c("knitr", "lubridate", "tidyverse", "kableExtra", "ggplot2"))
```

### Code Execution
The analysis is performed in R, and the code is available in the `analysis` directory. To execute the code, follow these steps:

1. Load the required libraries.
2. Read the cleaned data from the CSV file.
3. Perform data filtering and manipulation for specific analyses.
4. Generate tables and graphs to visualize trends.


## Folder Structure

- **inputs:** Contains input data and additional resources.
  - **llms:** Includes the chat history with the language model.
- **outputs:** Stores generated tables, graphs, and other output files.
- **scripts:** Holds R scripts for data simulating, downloading, cleaning, and tests.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `input/data` contains the data sources used in analysis including the raw data.
-   `outputs/data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `outputs/paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.
